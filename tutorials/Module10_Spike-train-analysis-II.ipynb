    "To support adaptive behavior, activity in the brain must correspond in some way \n",

    "combine many sources of information into multimodal percepts, \n",
    "and recall traces of past events to inform predictions about the future. \n",
    "In other words, neural activity must somehow _encode_ relevant quantities. \n",
    "For instance, it can be [demonstrated](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9817202)\n",
    "[behaviorally](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20141292)\n",
    "that many animals use estimates of their location and head direction to navigate towards a goal.\n",
    "Where, and how, are these quantities represented in the brain? \n",
    "What are the neural circuits that can compute and update these signals? \n",
    "How do place and direction estimates contribute to which way to go?\n",
    "\n",
    "This _information processing_ view of the brain has been extremely influential, \n",
    "as highlighted by the enduring appeal of [Hubel and Wiesel's demonstrations](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4966457)\n",
    "that single cells in macaque V1 respond to bars of light not only within a particular region of visual space, \n",
    "but also with a specific orientation. \n",
    "Such cells are said to be _tuned_ for orientation [of the bar] and a typical _tuning curve_ would therefore look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"10-tuning-curve.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "This tuning curve describes how the cell responds, on average, \n",
    "to different orientations of the stimulus. \n",
    "If the cell were to respond with the same firing rate across the range of stimulus orientations, \n",
    "then the cell is indifferent to this particular stimulus dimension: \n",
    "it does not encode it. \n",
    "However, because this cell clearly modulates its firing rate with stimulus orientation, \n",
    "it encodes, or represents (I use these terms interchangeably, but some disagree) this quantity in its activity. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can turn this idea around and note that if orientation is encoded, \n",
    "this implies we can also _decode_ the original stimulus from the cell's activity. \n",
    "For instance, if we noted that this cell was firing at a high rate, \n",
    "we would infer that the stimulus orientation is likely close to the cell's preferred direction. \n",
    "Note that this requires knowledge of the cell's tuning curve, \n",
    "and that based on one cell only, we are unlikely to be able to decode \n",
    "(or reconstruct, which means the same thing) the stimulus perfectly. \n",
    "The more general view is to say that the cell's activity provides a certain amount of information about the stimulus, \n",
    "or equivalently, that our (decoded) estimate of the stimulus is improved by taking the activity of this cell into account.\n",
