    "to access it. \n",
    "I recommend installing R2014a, an identifier that refers to a specific MATLAB release -- it is the first release of 2014. \n",

    "GitHub is a system for \"distributed version control\": \n",
    "it keeps track of changes to a set of files, such as pieces of MATLAB code, with one or more contributors. \n",
    "This system makes it easy to keep track of evolving code, and to share improvements between collaborators. \n",
    "Typical scenarios in which such version control is useful include, for instance, \n",
    "if you want to run the exact code that you used to generate some figure a while ago, \n",
    "but you've since made changes to the code; \n",
    "or the same analysis suddenly gives a different result and you want to track down what change caused it. \n",

    "\n",
    "If you don't already have a GitHub account, go to [GitHub](http://www.github.com) and sign up. \n",
    "E-mail me (mvdm at dartmouth dot edu) your account name, \n",
    "so I can give you write access to the code repository we will use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, download and install the Git client of your choice if you don't already have one installed. \n",
    "This is a piece of software that will allow you to talk to GitHub, which is where the code is actually stored. \n",
    "For Windows, I recommend [GitHub Windows](http://windows.github.com/) as a user-friendly way to get started. \n",
