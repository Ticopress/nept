    "Although there are exceptions, spikes are generally the only aspect of neural activity \n",
    "that is transmitted rapidly to postsynaptic targets. \n",
    "At the most general level, sensory input to the brain can be thought of as \n",
    "changing the patterns of spikes in associated sensory nuclei and brain regions; \n",
    "in turn, motor output is ultimately governed by patterns of spikes in motor areas. \n",

    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "To bin these spikes, we can use MATLAB's ''histc()'' function. \n",
    "This returns a histogram of spike counts, given a vector of bin edges:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "binsize = 0.1;\n",
    "tbin_edges = t(1):binsize:t(2); % vector of time bin edges (for histogram)\n",

    "spk_count = spk_count(1:end-1); % ignore spikes falling exactly on edge of last bin.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using ''histc'', it is key to remember that element _n_ of the output \n",
    "corresponds to the count in the interval $[edge(n) edge(n+1)]$. \n",
    "In other words, a spike occurring exactly at the time of the second edge will be assigned to output bin 2, not bin 1.\n",
    "As a result, ''histc()'' needs a special last bin for those spikes occurring exactly at the time of the last edge. \n",
    "The above code ignores this last bin, \n",
