    "## The difference equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing specific frequencies in the Fourier domain is an intuitive way to think about filtering,\n",
    "but this is not how filters are generally implemented. \n",
    "(There are several reasons for this, such as the difficulty in filtering real-time as samples are coming in.) \n",
    "Instead, digital filtering is typically accomplished with a _difference equation_ of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ y(n) = (b_0 x(n) + b_1 x(n - 1) + \\ldots + n_N x(n - N)) - a_1 y(n - 1) + a_2 y(n - 2) + \\ldots + a_M y(n - M)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This equation describes how to compute sample _n_ of the filtered signal _y_ from the original signal _x_. \n",
    "The value of _y(n)_ in general can be a function of an arbitrary number of past samples (-1, -2, etc.) of the original signal _x, \n",
    "as well as of _y_ itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "The coefficients ''b'' and ''a'' fully define the filter. \n",
    "Notice that a filter with only ''b'' coefficients depends only on the original signal _x_; \n",
    "that is, there are no _feedback_ terms taken from the filtered signal _y_. \n",
    "The ''a'' coefficients describe the feedback components. \n",
    "This distinction is the basis for the commonly used terms \"FIR\" (Finite Impulse Response; only ''b'' components) \n",
    "and \"IIR\" (Infinite Impulse Response, ''a'' components) to describe a filter. \n",
    "The behavior of IIR filters can be much more complex because of this feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another useful term to be aware of is the _order_ of a filter: \n",
    "this simply refers to the maximum number of samples back it looks. \n",
    "This is equivalent to the maximum number of coefficients ''a'' and ''b'' the filter has; \n",
    "''a(0)'' and ''b(0)'' always need to be defined \n",
    "(''a(0)'' is implicit on the left side in front of ''y(n)'', \n",
    "often omitted because it is generally 1) \n",
    "as well as at least one ''a'' or ''b'' for each sample back up to the maximum.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Technical note: the difference equation can be related to the frequency domain through the Z-transform; \n",
    "it is not necessary to understand this, but if you are curious, the Leis book has an explanation.)"

    "## An example using filter()\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of a simple filtering operation is to compute a running average. \n",

    "we see we can accomplish this using ''b'' coefficients only. \n",
    "How many coefficients we use will determine the size of the window (in samples) that we average over; \n",
    "the magnitude of the coefficients should be set so that we in fact get the mean, \n",

    "\n",
    "$$ y(n) = \\frac{1}{4} x(n) + \\frac{1}{4} x(n - 1) + \\frac{1}{4} x(n - 2) + \\frac{1}{4} x(n - 3) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using ''filter()'', we would simply do\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "a = 1; % a_0 is the (hidden) coefficient on the left side, in front of y(n)\n",
    "b = [1/4 1/4 1/4 1/4]; % four b's of 1/4 each so we get the mean\n",
    "\n",
    "y = filter(b,a,x); % x is the original signal, y the filtered version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this won't work because we don't have our input signal ''x'' defined yet. \n",
    "As a quick illustration (following \n",
    "[this](http://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/data_analysis/filtering-data.html)\n",
    "MATLAB page), we can do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "load count.dat;\n",
    "x = count(:,1);\n",

    "\n",
    "The filtered signal looks roughly as expected \n",
    "-- a nicely smoothed version of the original --\n",
    "but a few things are worth noting. \n",
    "Look at the first sample of the filtered signal: \n",
    "it equals ''x(1)/4'', which means that any values of ''x'' which we did not have were assumed to be zero. \n",
    "This is an example of an \"edge effect\"; in general we don't really think the signal we didn't sample is truly zero, \n",
    "but this is ''filter()'''s implicit, default assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another property of this filtered signal is that it is _phase-shifted_ to the right; \n",

    "_highpass_ filter (the reverse), \n",

    "<img src=\"06-filter-types.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that these illustrations are in the frequency domain: \n",
    "some frequencies are unchanged (0 dB; recall that the decibel is a common unit of signal power), \n",
    "while others are attenuated. \n",
    "The -3dB point is a common reference and corresponds to a 50% reduction in signal power (recall that dB is a log scale).\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we know what values of ''b'' and ''a'' will accomplish these filtering operations? \n",
    "Can the _optimal_ ''b'' and ''a'' for a given application be found? \n",

    "\n",
    "As may be expected from your experience with windowing and spectral leakage in the previous module, \n",
    "there is no ideal filter that completely rejects all unwanted frequencies while leaving all desired frequencies intact. \n",
    "Rather, different filters make different tradeoffs in terms of their frequency and phase response. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a _Butterworth_ filter has a maximally flat frequency response in the passband. \n",
    "However, its _rolloff_ (the transition from passband to stopband) is not as steep as that of _Chebyshev_ filters.\n",
    "In turn, Chebychev filters experience _ripple_ (some distortion) in either the passband or the stopband \n",
