    "# Introductory remarks\n",
    "\n",
    "Spike sorting is the process of assigning experimentally recorded voltage waveforms to putative single neurons. \n",
    "Extracellular recordings generally contain contributions from multiple neurons, \n",
    "as well as noise, and therefore cannot be directly converted to spike trains.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spike sorting process relies on the idea that extracellularly recorded waveforms are a function of \n",
    "(1) a neuron's morphological (size, shape) and electrical properties (channel distributions, states), and \n",
    "(2) the location of the recording electrode relative to the neuron \n",
    "(see [Buzsaki et al. 2012](http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v13/n6/abs/nrn3241.html)). \n",
    "Thus, waveforms generated by different neurons are expected to result in differently sized and shaped waveforms on a given electrode. \n",
    "\n",
    "If \"features\" extracted from these waveforms, such as their peak voltage, width, or energy (area under the curve squared)\n",
    "form distinct clouds in feature space, these clouds are inferred to correspond to distinct, isolated neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Spike sorting can be a laborious and frustrating process. \n",
    "It is surprising that despite decades of research, \n",
    "no satisfactory automated method has been found! \n",
    "One reason for this is that correct spike sorting needs to rely \n",
    "on just the right amount of domain knowledge of what is likely and unlikely: \n",
    "refractory periods, electrode instability, adaptation of action potential amplitude, and variation \n",
    "in where on the dendritic tree synaptic inputs arrive all affect the shape of clusters \n",
    "in ways that current automated methods do not capture well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, there is definitely satisfaction in spike sorting electrodes with plentiful clusters, \n",
    "in anticipation of the beautiful data set that will result!"

    "\n",
    "This image illustrates the process from extracellular potentials recorded by a tetrode (**b**) to spike trains (**h**). \n",
    "For our purposes, the most important steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- filtering of the raw data in the spike band (**c**)\n",
    "- detection of potential spikes (**d**; typically done by simply setting a threshold)\n",
    "- aligning potential spikes by the location of their peak (**e**)\n",
    "- extracting \"features\" such as the peak voltages or principal components (**f**)\n",
    "- clustering features into putative neurons (**g**)\n",
    "- obtaining the spike times for each cluster (**i**)\n",
    "\n",
    "Data acquisition systems (such as our Neuralynx Digital Lynx) \n",
    "can be configured to perform steps **b**-**e** on-line during recording, \n",
    "but recording only the raw data (**b**) is also an option. \n",
    "Recording the raw data affords opportunities to optimize steps **c**-**e** \n",
    "but is more storage- and time-intensive.\n",
