    "The spectral estimation methods introduced in the previous module \n",
    "average spectral content over a number of different windows. \n",
    "This means that we get an improved estimate of the _overall_ spectral content of the signal, \n",
    "but such an average cannot establish if the spectral content is changing over time. \n",
    "Neural signals rarely have stationary spectral properties, \n",
    "as illustrated by this snippet of a LFP from the rat ventral striatum (source: \n",
    "[van der Meer and Redish, 2009](http://www.frontiersin.org/integrative_neuroscience/10.3389/neuro.07.009.2009/abstract))\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"07-varied-spectral.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The top trace illustrates some striking properties of the ventral striatal LFP: \n",
    "under certain conditions, gamma oscillations appear in \"events\" of a relatively stereotyped length, \n",
    "with frequencies alternating between ~80 Hz (\"gamma-80\" or \"high gamma\") and ~50 Hz (\"gamma-50\" or \"low gamma\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we characterize the spectral properties of such a rapidly changing signal? \n",
    "One approach is illustrated in the colorful panel directly below the raw LFP trace \n",
    "-- this is a **spectrogram**. \n",
    "A spectrogram estimates the spectral content of a signal over time. \n",
    "It has time and frequency axes, with power shown in the color dimension \n",
    "(note the colorbar: in this plot, red is high power, blue is low power).\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectrogram is constructed by sliding a window along the signal \n",
    "and computing the power spectrum at each position of the window.\n",
    "As with the PSD estimators in the previous module such as Welch's method, \n",
    "the window is characterized by its size and shape (rectangular, Hamming, etc.) \n",
    "which control the tradeoffs resulting from spectral leakage. \n",
    "Unlike these PSD estimators however, to obtain a spectrogram we do not average across windows. \n",
    "Instead, we keep the spectrum for each position of the window, \n",
    "filling in each \"time\" column of the spectrogram as it moves along.\n",
    "\n",
    "(As an aside, spectrograms are a widely used tool for time-frequency analysis; \n",
    "for instance, they are often the first step in voice recognition software. \n",
    "Plotting a spectrogram of your own voice can be done with just a few lines of MATLAB code.)"

    "In contrast to this low-frequency transient, \n",
    "you can see that there are various gamma-range oscillations which extend over multiple cycles, \n",
