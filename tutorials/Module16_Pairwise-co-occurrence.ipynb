    "As you have seen in the module on [decoding](analysis:course-w16:week10), \n",

    "\n",
    "Consider this rat moving from right to left on a linear track. \n",
    "Passing through the place field of each cell (indicated by different colored circles) \n",
    "the firing order will be blue-cyan-green-yellow-orange-red. \n",
    "This firing order corresponds to the order different locations in the environment were experienced.\n",
    "\n",
    "In rats, memories of past experiences may be re-expressed in association with sharp wave-ripples (SWRs)\n",
    "in the local field potential: \n",
    "the spiking order of place cells during rest is correlated \n",
    "with the field order experienced in the environment \n",
    "(Wilson & McNaughton 1994; Foster & Wilson 2006; Karlsson et al. 2009). \n",
    "This non-local, ordered spiking activity has been called \"replay\":\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"16-replay.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Shown schematically are three putative SWRs, \n",
    "associated with a \"forward\" replay (cells active in same order as experienced), \n",
    "an indeterminate replay (no order detectable; \n",
    "may be a replay of some different experience from which we do not know the correct place cell order), \n",
    "and a \"reverse\" replay.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to quantify how much a rat is recalling a certain trajectory (\"experience\"). \n",
    "We could identify how many times certain trajectories are replayed, \n",
    "like the left trajectory or the right trajectory along arms of a T-maze. \n",

    "\n",
    "Co-activation or co-occurrence analysis allows us to examine the content of \"replay\" \n",
    "without direct reference to the field order of place cells in the environment (Cheng and Frank, 2008). \n",
    "By grouping place cells into categories such as \"left-arm place cells\" and \"right-arm place cells\" \n",
    "we can ask if left cells are significantly more active together than right cells, \n",
    "which would suggest that the rat may have been recalling the left arm more frequently than the right arm.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"16-cooccurrence-schematic.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "The logic of looking at pairwise co-occurrence is illustrated in the figure above. \n",
    "If a random selection of cells is active in each SWR, \n",
    "then their co-occurrence would not differ from what we expect based on the activity of each cell individually. \n",
    "This is the case for the \"red\" cells D-E-F in the diagram. \n",
    "If, in contrast, spiking patterns during SWRs form sequences, \n",
    "then cells with nearby place fields will tend to be active together, \n",
    "as is the case for the \"blue\" cells A-B-C. \n",
    "This concept of co-occurrence will be made more explicit for real data in the steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall workflow for co-occurrence analysis looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Generate candidate events**: these are intervals that may contain replays, \n",
    "generally associated with sharp wave-ripple events (SWRs) in the LFP\n",
    "- **Estimate place fields**: get locations in the environment where cells \n",
    "increased their firing rates during behavior\n",
    "- **Categorize place cells**: we want cells that were active on the left or right arm only.\n",
    "- **Make a Q-matrix**: Bin spiking activity during SWRs.\n",
    "- **Get cell participation during SWRs**: are right or left cells more active during SWRs?\n",
    "- **Get joint probability for cell pairs**: how often are right cells active together? \n",
    "How often are left cells active together?\n",
    "- **Get z-scored coactivity for cell pairs**: are the cell pairs co-active at greater than chance levels? \n",
    "(If the cells are firing randomly, we still expect them to co-occur to some degree)\n",
    "\n",
    "This module will first take you through how existing code accomplishes these steps. \n",
    "Then, the final section implements a basic version of the same analysis from scratch, \n",
    "so that you can get to know the guts of the analysis and build on it yourself."
