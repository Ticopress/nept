    "The above method of spectral estimation, \n",
    "obtaining the Fourier coefficients by applying the DFT to the entire data set, \n",
    "is also referred to as constructing a _periodogram_. \n",
    "MATLAB has a function for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "[Pxx,F] = periodogram(y,[],nP,Fs);\n",
    "plot(F,Pxx); xlabel('Frequency (Hz)');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this plots the _one-sided_ spectrum, \n",
    "and that the units on the frequency axis are now in Hz. \n",
    "In addition, rather than plotting the magnitudes of the sinusoid components as before, \n",
    "we now have _power_, which is simply the magnitude squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to change the window:\n",
    "\n",
    "```matlab\n",
    "hold on;\n",
    "[Pxx,F] = periodogram(y,hanning(length(y)),nP,Fs);\n",
    "plot(F,Pxx,'r');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note again the trading off of mainlobe width against sidelobe magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the periodogram, although usable, \n",
    "is not a very good spectral estimator in some ways; it is _biased_: \n",
    "its variance does not tend to zero as data length goes to infinity \n",
    "([details](http://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/spectral-analysis.html)). \n",
    "This makes later statistical comparisons difficult, and the spectrum look noisy, \n",
    "as we'll demonstrate in a later section. \n",
    "\n",
    "A useful approach to address these issues is to cut the signal up into smaller segments, \n",
    "estimate the spectrum for each segment, and combine the estimates, \n",
    "a process known as [Bartlett's method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bartlett's_method). \n",
    "An example of a spectral estimator that uses this approach is _Welch's method_, \n",
    "which uses segments (or windows) that can overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type ''help pwelch'' and read the overall description of what this function does.\n",
