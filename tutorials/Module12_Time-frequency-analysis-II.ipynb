    "\n",
    "In the previous module we saw that a _spectrogram_ can determine the frequency content of a signal over time. \n",
    "Often, spectrograms resulting from brain signals reveal rich patterns of interacting frequency bands.\n",
    "A simple example of this is the previously mentioned panel C of the first figure in the previous module: \n",
    "this shows that in the rat ventral striatum, gamma-50 and gamma-80 power tend to be slightly anticorrelated.\n",
    "More generally, we might ask, what structure is there in the spectrogram? \n",
    "What relationships exist between different frequency bands? \n",
    "Can we predict power based on the history of the signal? \n",
    "Beyond the power (amplitude) components of the spectrogram, an additional dimension is _phase_, \n",
    "which may enter in systematic relationships with power. \n",
    "For instance, in the hippocampus, gamma power tends to occur at certain phases of the slower theta (~8Hz) rhythm (Colgin et al. 2009). \n",
    "Such \"second-order\" relationships (built on the \"first-order\" spectrogram) are the focus of this module."
