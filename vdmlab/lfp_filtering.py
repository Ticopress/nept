    Parameters
    ----------
    lowcut : float
        Suggested 140.0 for sharp-wave ripple detection.
    highcut : float
        Suggested 250.0 for sharp-wave ripple detection.
    fs : int
        Eg. 2000. Should get this from experiment-specifics.
    lfp : np.array
        Eg. csc['data']
    order : int
        Default set to 4.

    Returns

    fs : int
        Experiment-specific, something in the range of 2000 is not unexpected.
    lowcut : float
        The default is set to 140.0

        The default is set to 3
